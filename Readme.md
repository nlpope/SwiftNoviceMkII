PROJECT TITLE
---------------------------------------------
SwiftNovice - A bootcamp in your pocket! SwiftNovice guides the user through prerequisite courses that got me to where I am today before providing them a set of real world projects via codementor.io.

GETTING STARTED (Requires a Mac)
---------------------------------------------
Download XCode at: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

Copy the project's clone link: available under button labeled 'Code' above

Clone the project in Xcode

(optional) plug your iphone into your Mac's port

At the very top, by the app's icon and title name select the iphone icon and a list of simulators should appear

In that list, select 'iphone' under the 'iOS Simulators' section (or choose the physical device plugged into your Mac's port')

This sets up your phone as the space the app will run on for the next step

WAIT! Before moving on to the next step, be sure to download and run the project in my repo titled "SwiftNoviceServerMkIII" (instructions enclosed within that project's README file')

Once device is selected, hit cmd + r (or hit the play button at the very top of the navigation bar) to run the app. 

You should see the app's icon appear on your homescreen before it opens automatically

Happy learning!
